# Fix for Admin Dashboard Login Issue

## Problem
After signing in to the admin dashboard, nothing appeared and there was a JavaScript syntax error in the console:
```
script.js:2590 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
```

## Root Cause
The syntax error was caused by an incomplete string in the Chart.js configuration within the `renderRevenueChart` function. Specifically, the `callback` function in the Y-axis ticks configuration had an incomplete return statement:
```javascript
callback: function(value) {
    return '  // Missing closing quote and value
}
```

## Solution
1. **Fixed the syntax error** by completing the return statement with the proper string:
   ```javascript
   callback: function(value) {
       return '$' + value;
   }
   ```

2. **Completed the incomplete function** by adding the missing closing brackets and error handling.

3. **Verified the renderCharts function** was properly calling both chart rendering functions.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `server/admin/JS/script.js` - Fixed syntax errors and completed incomplete functions

### Specific Fixes
1. Completed the `renderRevenueChart` function with proper Chart.js configuration
2. Added proper error handling for chart rendering functions
3. Ensured all brackets and parentheses are properly closed

### Chart Configuration Fixed
- Revenue chart Y-axis now properly formats values with dollar signs
- Booking trends chart Y-axis now properly formats integer values
- Both charts now properly destroy and recreate on data updates

## Verification
After making these changes:
1. The JavaScript syntax error is resolved
2. The admin dashboard should now properly load after login
3. Charts in the Reports & Analytics section should render correctly
4. Month/year filtering should work properly

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to the admin login page
2. Log in with valid credentials
3. The dashboard should appear with all statistics and charts
4. Select different months/years to verify filtering works
5. Check browser console for any remaining JavaScript errors
