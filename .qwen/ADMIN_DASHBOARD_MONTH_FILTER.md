# Dynamic Month Filtering Implementation for Admin Dashboard

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of dynamic month filtering for the admin dashboard in the hotel booking application. The feature allows administrators to filter financial and booking data by specific months and years.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend HTML Updates

#### Dashboard Section (`server/admin/index.html`)
- Updated the month selector in the "Recent Bookings" section to include all 12 months
- Added a container div with flex gap for better styling

#### Reports Section (`server/admin/index.html`)
- Replaced the period-based selectors with separate month and year selectors
- Added month selectors with values 1-12 for both Revenue Overview and Booking Trends
- Added year selectors with options for 2023, 2024, and 2025

### 2. Frontend JavaScript Updates

#### Dashboard Data Loading (`server/admin/JS/script.js`)
- Modified `loadDashboardData()` function to read the selected month from the month selector
- Added logic to convert month names to month numbers for API requests
- Added event listener for the month selector to trigger data reload on change

#### Reports Data Loading (`server/admin/JS/script.js`)
- Modified `loadReportsData()` function to read selected month and year values
- Updated API calls to include month and year parameters
- Added event listeners for all month/year selectors to trigger data reload on change

### 3. Backend API Support

The backend API already supports month and year filtering through query parameters:
- `/api/admin/dashboard/stats?month=9&year=2025`
- `/api/financial/summary?month=9&year=2025`

## Features Implemented

1. **Dashboard Month Filtering**:
   - Dropdown selector with all 12 months
   - Automatic data refresh when month is changed
   - Filters both statistics and recent bookings table

2. **Reports Month/Year Filtering**:
   - Separate month and year selectors for Revenue Overview
   - Separate month and year selectors for Booking Trends
   - Real-time data updates when selections change

3. **Financial Management**:
   - Existing financial summary endpoint supports month/year filtering
   - Can be extended to include selectors on the financials page

## Usage

### Dashboard
1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard
2. Use the month dropdown above the "Recent Bookings" table to select a month
3. Dashboard statistics and bookings table will automatically update

### Reports
1. Navigate to the Reports & Analytics section
2. Use the month and year dropdowns in the "Revenue Overview" section
3. Use the month and year dropdowns in the "Booking Trends" section
4. Data will automatically update when selections change

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard/stats?month={month}&year={year}`
- `GET /api/admin/bookings/overview?month={month}&year={year}`
- `GET /api/financial/summary?month={month}&year={year}`

### Query Parameters
- `month`: Integer from 1-12 representing the month
- `year`: 4-digit year (e.g., 2025)

### Default Behavior
- When no filters are applied, data shows for the current month/year
- All selectors maintain their previous selections during page navigation

## Future Enhancements

1. Add "All Months" option to clear month filtering
2. Implement date range selection for custom periods
3. Add visual indicators showing when data is filtered
4. Include comparison features (vs. previous period, etc.)
5. Add selectors to the Financial Management section
