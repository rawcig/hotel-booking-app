# Fix for Missing renderDashboardTable Function

## Issue
The `renderDashboardTable` function was being called in the `loadDashboardData` function but was not defined, causing a JavaScript error when the dashboard loaded.

## Solution
Implemented the missing `renderDashboardTable` function that:

1. Takes an array of booking data as input
2. Populates the dashboard table with booking information
3. Handles empty data and error cases gracefully
4. Formats dates and currency values properly
5. Applies status styling using CSS classes

## Implementation Details

### Function Signature
```javascript
function renderDashboardTable(bookings)
```

### Features
- **Data Population**: Renders booking data in the dashboard table
- **Empty State**: Shows "No bookings found" message when data is empty
- **Error State**: Shows "Error loading data" message on error
- **Date Formatting**: Uses existing `formatDate` utility function
- **Currency Formatting**: Uses existing `formatCurrency` utility function
- **Status Styling**: Applies appropriate CSS classes for booking status

### Table Columns
1. Booking ID
2. Guest Name
3. Check-in Date
4. Check-out Date
5. Hotel Name
6. Total Price (formatted as currency)
7. Status (with colored badges)

### Event Handling
- Added proper event listener initialization
- Set default month selection to current month
- Connected month selector to data reload functionality

## Testing
The function has been implemented and tested to ensure:
- No JavaScript errors on page load
- Proper data rendering when bookings are available
- Graceful handling of empty data
- Correct formatting of dates and currency
- Proper status badge styling

This fix resolves the missing function error and enables the dashboard to properly display booking data.
