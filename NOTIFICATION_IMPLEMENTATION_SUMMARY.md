# Booking Status Change Notification Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of push notifications for booking status changes (confirmed, cancelled, check-in/out) in the Hotel Booking App.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Functions
Created PostgreSQL functions to automatically generate notifications when booking statuses change:
- `send_booking_confirmed_notification()`: Sends notification when booking is confirmed
- `send_booking_cancelled_notification()`: Sends notification when booking is cancelled
- `send_checkin_reminder()`: Sends reminder 1 day before check-in
- `send_checkout_reminder()`: Sends reminder on check-out day

### 2. Database Triggers
Implemented triggers that automatically call the notification functions:
- `trigger_booking_confirmed_notification`: Fires on booking confirmation
- `trigger_booking_cancelled_notification`: Fires on booking cancellation
- `trigger_checkin_reminder`: Fires for check-in reminders
- `trigger_checkout_reminder`: Fires for check-out reminders

### 3. Enhanced Booking Service
Updated the booking service to send push notifications:
- Booking confirmation notifications
- Booking cancellation notifications
- Error handling for notification failures

### 4. Database Notification Service
Created a service to process database notifications and convert them to push notifications:
- Processes pending notifications from database
- Converts database notifications to push notifications
- Updates notification status (sent/failed)
- Provides notification statistics

### 5. Notification Context Integration
Enhanced the notification context to:
- Process database notifications periodically
- Provide notification processing functions
- Manage notification permissions

### 6. Notifications Screen
Updated the notifications screen to:
- Display database notifications from the notifications table
- Show notification status (pending, sent, failed)
- Provide pull-to-refresh functionality
- Show notification type and status badges

## Notification Types

### Booking Confirmation
- Triggered when a booking is confirmed
- Message: "Your booking at [hotel] from [check-in] to [check-out] is confirmed. Total: [price]. Booking ID: [id]"

### Booking Cancellation
- Triggered when a booking is cancelled
- Message: "Your booking at [hotel] for [check-in] has been successfully cancelled. Booking ID: [id]"

### Check-in Reminder
- Triggered 1 day before check-in
- Message: "Don't forget! Your check-in at [hotel] is tomorrow. We look forward to welcoming you!"

### Check-out Reminder
- Triggered on check-out day
- Message: "Your stay at [hotel] ends today. Please check out by 12:00 PM. Thank you for choosing us!"

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The notifications table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    guest_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES public.guests(id),
    type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (type IN ('email', 'sms')),
    subject TEXT,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'sent', 'failed')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Notification Flow
1. Booking status changes in database
2. Database trigger fires appropriate notification function
3. Function creates database notification record
4. DatabaseNotificationService periodically processes pending notifications
5. Service converts database notifications to push notifications
6. Notification status updated to 'sent' or 'failed'
7. User receives push notification on their device

## Benefits

1. **Automated Notifications**: No manual intervention required for sending notifications
2. **Reliable Delivery**: Database notifications ensure no notifications are lost
3. **Status Tracking**: Clear visibility into notification delivery status
4. **User Experience**: Timely updates on booking status changes
5. **Scalability**: Database-based approach can handle high volumes
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging

## Testing

To test the notification functionality:

1. Create a new booking - should receive confirmation notification
2. Cancel a booking - should receive cancellation notification
3. Check notifications screen - should display database notifications
4. Verify notification status updates in database

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scheduled Reminders**: More sophisticated reminder scheduling
2. **Notification Preferences**: Allow users to customize notification types
3. **Email Integration**: Send email notifications in addition to push notifications
4. **SMS Integration**: Send SMS notifications for critical updates
5. **Rich Notifications**: Add images and action buttons to notifications
6. **Analytics**: Track notification open rates and engagement
