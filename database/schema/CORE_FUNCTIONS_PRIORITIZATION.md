## Implementation Order Recommendation

Based on dependencies and priority:

1. **Booking Management** - Core functionality already partially exists
2. **User Management** - Already largely implemented
3. **Hotel Management** - Independent, high-value feature
4. **Room Management** - Dependent on hotel management
5. **Staff Management** - Supports other management functions
6. **Reservation System** - Connects bookings with rooms
7. **Financial Management** - Dependent on reservations
8. **Notification System** - Enhances user experience
9. **Reporting & Analytics** - Built on top of all other data

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the database schema to your Supabase instance
2. Implement the backend API endpoints for each core function
3. Create the admin dashboard UI components
4. Test the complete workflow for each prioritized function
